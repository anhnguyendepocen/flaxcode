# Introduction #


The document collection (or just "collection" when clear from context) is a central notion in Flax. A collection is a specification of a set of documents. For Flax 1.0 this is simply a set of files, but for future versions will include things like a set of urls. A collection also specifies some aspects of how, and when, it's constituent documents are indexed.

Note well that there may be some properties of document collections that are not presented to the end user in the web application. The design of the interface might hide aspects of the underlying objects.

## General Properties ##

A document collection has:

  * A name, which identifies it uniquely amongst the document collections in the system.

  * A description, which describes the documents of the collection

These are both text fields of arbitrary length. However the user interface is designed with the expectation that names will be relatively short - probably a single word is best.


## Files Specification ##


The set of files for a collection can be specified by providing:


  * A set of paths. Each path stands for (recursively) all the files below it if it is a directory, or itself if it is a regular file.

  * A set of formats. This is used to denote the types of files in the collection.


  * An earliest date and a latest date. These are used to limit the modification dates of files in the collection.

  * A youngest and oldest duration. These are used to limit the age of the files in the collection at the time of indexing.


The files of the collection at a given indexing time are then every
file `f` such that:


  * `f` is in a directory below a path on the path set, or f is in the path set; and


  * `f` is of one of the formats in the set of formats; and


  * `f` was modified on or after the earliest date; and


  * `f` was modified on or before the latest date; and


  * `f` is older than the youngest duration; and


  * `f` is younger than the oldest duration.




### Symlinks ###


Symlinks are not followed.  If the target is inside the collection the target will be indexed anyway, and if the target isn't inside the collection, following symlinks could cause files to be indexed which the users meant to keep private. A warning will be emitted when symlinks are encountered.


### Future Improvements ###


We do not have an explicit exclusions property - i.e. subdirectories of paths that should be skipped. We don't need this for 1.0, but we should add it soon after.


We might want to add an option to follow symlinks.  We also might want to make the warning about non-followed symlinks only be displayed if the target is not in the collection (but this is a hard condition to check in general)

## Mapping Specification ##

The mapping specification is a mechanism for mapping files of the collection to urls. This allows search result pages to give a link for viewing or downloading documents in the search results.

The mapping specification is conceptually a set of `(path, url)` pairs, where every path of the collections paths property has exactly one such pair.


## Indexing Specification ##


The results obtained from Xapian searches depend, in part, on options set for the database. The indexing of the collection is influence by the following settings:


  * language: This effects how stemming works for documents in the collection. See the Xapian [stemming](http://www.xapian.org/docs/stemming.html) discusion for more detail.


  * stopwords: Words that are ignored when indexing.  This may reduce the database size considerably, but does limit the kinds of searches which can be performed.


### Future Improvements ###


After 1.0, we may wish to add support for multiple languages in a single collection.  However, at present, we will assume that each collection is in a single language.


## Scheduling Specification ##


The documents of a collection must be processed and the resulting data added to a xapian database in order for searches to be performed. Indexing is relatively expensive so should not be performed more often than needed. On the other hand the real user requirement will normally be to search the actual files of the collection, not the files at the last time they were indexed, so indexing should happen sufficiently often that the database is not badly out of sync with the files of the collections.


The scheduling options control how frequently a collection is indexed. (The web application also allows that indexing is requested on demand, so it is possible to have a usable system without any scheduled indexing.) The scheduling specification for a collection has the following properties. (Ranges are from and including, to and excluding).


(This is essentially a simplified [crontab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crontab) entry.)



  * minutes: a list of numbers in the range 0-60

  * hours: a list of numbers in the range 0-24

  * days of week: a list of numbers in the range 0-31o

  * days of month: a list of numbers in the range 0-31

  * months: a list of number in the range 0-12


In addition each of these properties may have the value `*`. The system will ensure that indexing is requested at times. `*` means all and numbers mean the corresponding date or time component.


### Future improvements ###


We may wish to add a simple interface to the scheduler, allowing a few standard options to be chosen (eg, every "N" hours) without needing to design a full scheduling specification.

We may wish to specify that indexing should happen only when system load (or perhaps, searches / hour) is below a certain level.
