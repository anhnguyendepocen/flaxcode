# D2: Web Server #

For this milestone we will develop a web server that serves the pages
generated from the templates developed in [D1](D1.md). Administrator pages
and functionality will protected by HTTP authentication.

We will use CherryPy and HTMLTemplate as web server and web templating
languages respectively.

The web server will contain stubs for functionalty to be written as
part of other milestones.
