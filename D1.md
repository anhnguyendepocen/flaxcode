# D1: Prototype Web Front End #


For this milestone we will develop:

  * A set of HTML templates, using [HTMLTemplate](http://freespace.virgin.net/hamish.sanderson/htmltemplate.html) showing the main pages of the Flax web front end.

  * Some CSS to make the pages look reasonable (although the intention here is not to have production ready CSS, but something that's usable during the rest of the development of Flax 1.0

  * Enough python to render the templates as HTML for viewing in a browser.

We will need at least the following web pages for Flax administrators (in no special order):

  * Collection listing page, which:
    * shows a summary of collections;
    * provides links to access a detail page for each collection;
    * provides a way of deleting collections (with some sort of confirmation).

  * Collection detail page, which:
    * shows all available information about a collection;
    * provides mechanisms for changing all properties of collections (that can be changed)

  * Global settings page which shows, and allows for modification, all the global settings of the system.

  * Log viewing page(s).

For end users we need:

  * Simple query page - enter a search query and submit it.
  * Advanced query page - Submit a complex query using a form that helps build the query.
  * Search results page.


As far as possible the pages will have a consistent look and feel out
of the box and incluing a navigation bar for ease of moving between
pages. The pages will allow for customization by adminstrators, either
by changing the CSS or editing the templates themselves.
