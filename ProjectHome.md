# Flax #

[Flax ](http://www.flax.co.uk) is a project to develop an open source enterprise search engine application based on the Xapian search engine library, and the [Xappy](http://code.google.com/p/xappy) interface built on top of Xapian.

## Download ##

You can now download a pre-release packaged version of Flax for Windows, Flax Basic. You can also download an alpha version of the [Flax Search Service](http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/wiki/FlaxSearchServiceIndex), a Web Service interface to Flax, and some example clients. The packages are available on the right of this page ('Featured downloads').

Developers are welcome to check out our sources from SVN (see the "Source" tab).

## Developers ##

Flax is being developed by the [Flax team](http://www.flax.co.uk), but contributions from third parties are welcome.

The Flax team also contribute to the development of [Xapian](http://xapian.org/), the search engine library used as the basis of Flax, and [Xappy](http://code.google.com/p/xappy), the Python interface to Xapian used by Flax.

## Mailing lists ##

There is a low traffic announcement mailing list, which you should subscribe to if you wish to be notified of new releases of Flax and of any critical issues found in the software.  This is called [Flax-Announce](http://groups.google.com/group/flax-announce), and is a read-only list.

There is a mailing list for general discussion of Flax - this is called [Flax-Discuss](http://groups.google.co.uk/group/flax-discuss).

There is also an automated mailing list which tracks all changes made to the flax code, and all comments in the issue tracker.  This is probably only of interest to developers working directly on the flax code: it is called [Flax-Changes](http://groups.google.com/group/flax-changes) and is hosted by google groups.  It is a read-only list.
